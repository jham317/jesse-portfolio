# Portfolio Project README

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and information about me. I designed and implemented this portfolio to provide a professional online presence and showcase my work to potential employers and collaborators.

## Technologies Used

- React: Used for building the UI components and managing the dynamic content.
- Styled Components: Employed for styling the components with CSS-in-JS approach.
- Framer Motion: Used for adding smooth animations and transitions.
- React Icons for more interesting aesthetic, however some of the icons could be ambiguous in meaning (my Nav specifically) so i setup a hover function to display in words what they are.
- UseState too create a form submission for prospective employers, will finish with backend code when finished bootcamp.

## Design Considerations

- **Color Palette:** I chose a color palette that reflects my personal brand and style. The color scheme is inspired by pastel colour schemes, while employing a dark mode feature. 
- **Typography:** I selected fonts that are both visually appealing and easy to read across different devices.
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## Features

- **Hero Section:** A visually appealing introduction section with a profile picture, title, and brief introduction.
- **Projects:** Displayed a selection of my projects with descriptions, images.
- **Contact Form:** Included a contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.
- **Theme Toggle:** Implemented a light and dark theme toggle for user preference.


## Future Enhancements

- **Add More Projects:** Continuously update and showcase new projects as I work on them.
- **Blog Section:** Integrate a blog section to share my thoughts and insights on various topics.
- **Improved Mobile Experience:** Refine the layout and interactions for mobile users.
- **API's and full MERN project:** Create a full-stack web app when I have learned those skills.
